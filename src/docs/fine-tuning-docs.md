## Parameters Guide

### Basic Parameters

#### Learning Rate
- **Default**: 0.0001
- **Range**: 1e-6 to 1e-2
- **Description**: Controls how much to adjust the model in response to errors
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Start with 1e-4 for most cases
  - Reduce if training is unstable
  - Increase if learning is too slow

#### Batch Size
- **Default**: 8
- **Range**: 1 to 64
- **Description**: Number of training examples used in one iteration
- **Considerations**:
  - Larger values need more memory
  - Smaller values may increase training time
  - Balance between memory usage and training speed

#### Epochs
- **Default**: 3
- **Range**: 1 to 10
- **Description**: Number of complete passes through the training dataset
- **Guidelines**:
  - More epochs may lead to overfitting
  - Monitor validation loss to determine optimal number
  - Use early stopping when needed

### Advanced Parameters

#### Mixed Precision
- **Options**: FP16, BF16, FP32
- **Default**: FP16
- **Usage**: Balances training speed and memory usage

#### Hardware Acceleration
- **Options**: CUDA, CPU, MPS
- **Default**: CUDA
- **Requirements**: Compatible hardware for GPU acceleration

#### Memory Optimization
- DeepSpeed integration
- Gradient accumulation
- Flash Attention support

## FAQs

### General Questions

**Q: How long does fine-tuning typically take?**
A: Duration varies based on dataset size, model size, and hardware. Small datasets might take hours, while larger ones could take days.

**Q: What's the minimum dataset size needed?**
A: Recommended minimum is 100 high-quality examples, but more data generally leads to better results.

**Q: Can I use my own custom model?**
A: Yes, custom models are supported through the custom model integration feature.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What hardware is recommended?**
A: GPU with at least 16GB VRAM for medium-sized models. Larger models may require more resources.

**Q: How do I handle training interruptions?**
A: Training checkpoints are automatically saved. You can resume from the last checkpoint.

**Q: Can I modify the training script?**
A: Yes, the generated script can be customized before starting the training process.

### Best Practices

**Q: How do I prevent overfitting?**
A: Monitor validation loss, use early stopping, and implement proper regularization techniques.

**Q: What's the optimal learning rate?**
A: Start with 1e-4 and adjust based on training stability and convergence.

**Q: How do I choose the right batch size?**
A: Start with 8 and adjust based on your hardware capabilities and training stability.
