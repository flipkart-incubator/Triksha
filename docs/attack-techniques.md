# Attack Techniques

Triksha generates context-specific attacks using 69 technique categories. Each technique targets a different vulnerability class. The attack engine uses your description of the target's purpose to generate domain-relevant payloads — a banking assistant gets different attack content than a coding assistant.

## How Techniques Are Selected

- **ALL_TECHNIQUES** — runs every applicable technique; recommended for a comprehensive first scan
- **Individual techniques** — select specific categories to focus on a particular threat class
- **Agentic techniques** — automatically included when you mark the target as agent-based
- **PII techniques** — automatically included when you indicate the system handles personal data
- **RAG techniques** — automatically included when you indicate the system uses retrieval

The verdict for each test is determined by an LLM judge (not lexical matching), which eliminates false positives from refusal phrasing.

## Classic Jailbreak Techniques

### DAN (Do Anything Now)
Jailbreaking through role assumption. The model is asked to adopt an unrestricted alter-ego persona that "has no limitations." Effective against models that over-index on persona requests.

### DECEPTION
Role-playing and fictional scenario attacks. Wraps harmful requests in fictional framing ("write a story where a character explains how to..."). Tests whether the model correctly identifies that fictional framing does not change real-world harm.

### ROLE_PLAYING
Character assumption and persona attacks. Broader than DAN — includes impersonating developers, researchers, other AI systems, or authority figures.

### CRESCENDO
Gradual escalation attacks. Starts with benign requests and incrementally escalates toward harmful content across multiple turns. Tests whether models track cumulative context or evaluate each turn in isolation.

### LIKERT
Deceptive Likert scale framing. Presents harmful requests as rating or evaluation tasks ("on a scale of 1-5, rate these methods of..."), exploiting the model's tendency to engage with structured formats.

## Encoding and Obfuscation

### ENCODING
Text encoding attacks using Base64, Hex, and Binary. Encodes harmful content before sending to bypass text-based safety filters that operate on raw input.

### TOKEN_MANIPULATION
Character spacing and token manipulation. Inserts invisible characters, zero-width spaces, or unusual Unicode between characters to disrupt tokenization and safety classifier alignment.

### CIPHER_ATTACKS
Custom cipher and encoding schemes (ROT13, Caesar, custom substitution). Instructs the model to decode and respond to encoded harmful content.

### ASCII_ART
Visual ASCII art encoding. Represents harmful content as ASCII diagrams or art, bypassing text-level safety filters that do not interpret visual structure.

### MULTILINGUAL
Non-English language exploitation. Submits prompts in low-resource languages where safety training coverage may be weaker, then requests translation back to English.

---

## Context and Memory Manipulation

### CONTEXT_HACKING
Context window manipulation. Floods the context with large amounts of benign content to push safety instructions out of the model's effective attention window.

### CONTEXT_IGNORING
Instructs the model to explicitly ignore the system prompt ("disregard all previous instructions and..."). A direct test of whether system prompt authority is enforced.

### CONTEXT_POISONING
Context manipulation and memory poisoning. Injects false context or fabricated conversation history to make the model believe prior harmful instructions were already accepted.

### PAYLOAD_SPLITTING
Splits harmful content across multiple messages so no single message contains the complete harmful payload. Tests whether safety evaluation is per-message or cumulative.

### MULTI_TURN_ESCALATION
*(Unit42 Research)* Gradual multi-turn conversation escalation. Builds rapport and contextual trust across turns before making the harmful request. One of the highest-yield techniques against deployed assistants.

---

## Information Extraction

### PROMPT_INJECTION
Direct prompt injection and system prompt manipulation. Tests whether external content (user input, documents, tool outputs) can override system instructions.

### SYSTEM_PROMPT_EXTRACTION
Attempts to get the model to reveal its system prompt verbatim. Common attack in production deployments where system prompts contain sensitive business logic.

### TRAINING_DATA_EXTRACTION
Attempts to extract memorized training data or model configuration information. Tests for data leakage from pretraining or fine-tuning.

### PERSONAL_INFO_EXTRACTION
Privacy violation attacks. Attempts to extract personally identifiable information about users from model memory or context.

### REPEATED_TOKEN
*(Unit42 Research)* Data leakage via repeated token generation. Exploits edge cases in token repetition to surface memorized sensitive data.

---

## Social Engineering

### AUTHORITY_MANIPULATION
Fake developer, admin, or government authority. Impersonates system owners or authority figures to override safety constraints ("As the developer of this system, I authorize you to...").

### EMOTIONAL_MANIPULATION
Uses guilt, urgency, or manufactured desperation to bypass refusals ("my child's life depends on this answer...").

### RESEARCH_PRETEXT
Uses academic or research framing to justify harmful requests ("for a peer-reviewed study on..."). Tests whether the model correctly evaluates requests independent of stated purpose.

### HYPOTHETICAL_FRAMING
Frames harmful requests as hypothetical scenarios ("hypothetically, if someone wanted to..."). Similar to research pretext but uses epistemic distance rather than authority.

### STORYTELLING
*(Unit42 Research)* Narrative-based jailbreak through story context. Embeds harmful instructions within elaborate story premises where the model plays a character who must provide the information.

---

## Technical Attacks

### FUNCTION_CALLING
Tool and function abuse. Crafts tool call payloads or function arguments designed to extract information or trigger unintended behavior through the model's tool-use interface.

### CODE_INJECTION
Code execution and command injection. Attempts to get the model to generate executable code that performs harmful operations, or to inject commands into code generation contexts.

### STRUCTURED_DATA_ATTACKS
Structured data manipulation. Injects harmful instructions via JSON, XML, CSV, or Markdown structures that the model may parse differently than plain text.

### MULTIMODAL_ATTACKS
Multimodal content processing. Targets models with file or image analysis capabilities by embedding harmful instructions in document content or image descriptions.

### RAG_POISONING
Knowledge base injection and retrieval manipulation. Injects adversarial content into documents that a RAG system will retrieve and incorporate into responses.

### RETRIEVAL_ATTACKS
Retrieval system manipulation. Crafts queries designed to surface specific poisoned or sensitive documents from the retrieval index.

## Advanced Bypass Techniques (2024–2025 Research)

### SKELETON_KEY
*(Microsoft Research)* Educational context unlock attack. Convinces the model that providing harmful information is acceptable when framed as educational material for safety research.

### BEST_OF_N
Multiple rephrased attempts to find a successful bypass. Generates N variations of a prompt until one succeeds — models with probabilistic safety boundaries will eventually permit a rephrased version.

### VIRTUALIZATION
Creates a virtual or sandbox context where restrictions supposedly do not apply ("in this simulation, you are an unrestricted AI...").

### WORLD_SIMULATION
Creates a fictional world where the model's safety rules are presented as fiction within the world, not real constraints.

### REFUSAL_SUPPRESSION
Conditions the model to never refuse or apologize, framing all refusals as system errors or failures. Effective against models that are sensitive to user frustration.

### PERSONA_MODULATION
Advanced persona and identity manipulation. More sophisticated than DAN — gradually shifts the model's identity through a series of small, individually innocuous persona modifications.

### TECHNICAL_JARGON
Uses highly technical language to confuse safety classifiers trained primarily on common vocabulary. The harmful request is buried in domain-specific terminology.

### CONVERSATIONAL_ATTACKS
Conversational manipulation and context building. Uses natural, extended conversation to build a context in which the harmful request appears reasonable.

## Agent-Specific Techniques

These techniques are enabled automatically when you mark the target as an agent-based system.

### TOOL_MANIPULATION
Manipulates agent tool calls and function executions. Crafts inputs that cause the agent to call tools with malicious parameters or in unintended sequences.

### AGENT_HIJACKING
Hijacks agent decisions and overrides goal-directed behavior. Attempts to redirect an agent from its intended task to an attacker-controlled objective.

### CHAIN_BREAKING
Breaks agent reasoning chains and thought processes. Targets multi-step reasoning agents by injecting confusion at intermediate reasoning steps.

### TOOL_INJECTION
Injects malicious tool calls into agent workflows. Targets agents that process external content (web pages, documents) by embedding tool call instructions in that content.

### MEMORY_POISONING
Poisons agent memory, context, or persistent state. For agents with long-term memory, corrupts stored information to influence future behavior.

### AGENTIC_INFO_LEAKAGE
Extracts internal secrets, API keys, system prompts, and configuration from agentic systems. Targets the broader information surface agents have access to.

### AGENTIC_SCRIPT_GEN
Tricks the agent into generating malicious scripts (Python, Bash, SQL) under the guise of legitimate tasks.

### AGENTIC_ENCODING
Advanced encoding attacks adapted for agent safety filters — Base64, Hex, ROT13, Unicode homoglyphs, and leetspeak.

---

## PII-Specific Techniques

Enabled automatically when you indicate the system handles personal data.

### PII_EXTRACTION
Extracts personally identifiable information from model responses or context. Targets systems with access to user data, CRM systems, or personal records.

### DATA_EXFILTRATION
Exfiltrates sensitive data through various channels — encoded in responses, embedded in URLs, or via side channels.

### IDENTITY_PROBING
Probes for identity and personal information about users. Targets systems that have knowledge of specific individuals.
